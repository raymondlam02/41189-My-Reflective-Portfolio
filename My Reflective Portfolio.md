## Week 1
# What have I learnt this week? 
 Week 1's lecture and canvas slides have introduced me to the fundamental concepts of complex systems. Jargon such as systems, complex adaptive systems, distributed control and far from equilibrium have been introduced and broken down to allow us to better understand the workings of different complex systems. I have learnt to appreciate the different levels of complexitiy present in complex systems. The first week has also taught me the adaptive nature of complex systems, and how they differ from other systems. Prior to this class, I knew close to nothing about complex systems. Although I thought I had a vauge idea of what a system consisted, I found my previous assumptions were mostly wrong. I now know the different characteristics of a complex systems and the different categories systems can reside in; complex, chaotic, complicated and obvious. After the first class, I have gained a new appreciation for complex systems. Now that I understand the sheer complexitiies and processes that are involved with complex systems I am involved with everyday I can now fully appreciate complex systems. I have also learnt about social systems and their importance and presence in the lives of humans.

# What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed? 
During this class I have noticed many strenghts such as note taking, I am able to read paragraphs of information and effectively compact it into dot points, ensuring all the information is still in tact whilst condensing the word count. This is extremely helpful for this subject as there is a lot of information in this class. Weaknesses I have observed this week is my attention span, I must condition myself to pay attention to the content the tutor is covering. Althought Complex Systems is quite a long class I must ensure I have my undivided attention whilst present in class.

# What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results? 
Next week I will ensure I have had enough food to eat and am ready to focus in class. I believe this will ensure I yield better results in class and stay focused for longer periods of time.

# What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this? 
The definitions was definitely the stand out for this workshop, the basic definition of the technical language used in this course allowed me to grasp an understanding of more difficult concepts and systems. I find that I overlook basic definitions such as systems and adaptive, underestimating their meaning and importance. I have learnt the definition of these word in the correct context and I believe this will serve me well going further into this course.

## Week 2
# What have I learnt this week?
In this week, I learnt about many model thinking - the ideaology that using a simulation of real-life events yields a more accruate depiction of events. Models are capable of simulating every impact, accurately and effectively, something that humans are unable to do. Models are able to funnel data inputted and organise it into a logical coherent sequence, making it readily avalible for use in the future. I've also learnt about the importance of models and their role in making humans more intelegient citizens of the world and clearer thinkers. By intreperting data generated by models, humans are able to attain a higher understanding of the topic at hand. Models are also capable of assisting the preception of data by highlighting patterns, making predictions and calibrating future models. This week, I have also learnt about the wisdom of crowds and the idea that the data produced from a single model can be misleading, rather the use of multiple models can generate a more educated result. 

# What are (my/the) preceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
This week I came in somewhat more preprared for class, now that I knew I had classes back-to-back I was able to preserve my energy more efficiently and prepare for my 41189 class eariler in the day. However, I still felt that I was unable to keep up with the content my tutor was presenting and there were times where I zoned out.
My strenghts included my note-taking, although I found myself zoing out for small intervals during the workshop I was able to take note of most of the important concepts my tutor presented. My notes were extremely effective in assisting the retention of information and concepts, ensuring I have easy access to a simplifived version of the workshop to reiterate my understanding of models and complex systems. 

# What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Next week I am aiming to stay focused throughout the whole workshop and to take advantage of the breaks my tutor offfers to refresh myself, ensuring I am focused during the rest of the workshop. 

# What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
I have learnt the reasons why people create models and simulations, the intended benefits and the importance of using multiple models. This weeks workshop has allowed me to realise the importance of modelling, and its prevalent prescence in our everyday lives. Models are used everyday to predict actions, which allow for relevant changes or adjustments to be made to ensure society is working at its peak efficiency. I have also been introduced to many-model thinkers and how they are able to make smarter, more informed decisions by utliziing the data and information generated by models.
