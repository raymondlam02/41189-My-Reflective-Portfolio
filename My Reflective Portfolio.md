## Week 2
# What have I learnt this week? 
 Week 1's lecture and canvas slides have introduced me to the fundamental concepts of complex systems. Jargon such as systems, complex adaptive systems, distributed control and far from equilibrium have been introduced and broken down to allow us to better understand the workings of different complex systems. I have learnt to appreciate the different levels of complexitiy present in complex systems. The first week has also taught me the adaptive nature of complex systems, and how they differ from other systems.
 
# What do I 'now know' that I did not before? 
Prioir to this class, I knew close to nothing about complex systems. Although I thought I had a vauge idea of what a system consisted, I found my previous assumptions were mostly wrong. I now know the different characteristics of a complex systems and the different categories systems can reside in; complex, chaotic, complicated and obvious.

# What insights have I gained?
After the first class, I have gained a new appreciation for complex systems. Now that I understand the sheer complexitiies and processes that are involved with complex systems I am involved with everyday I can now fully appreciate complex systems. I have also learnt about social systems and their importance and presence in the lives of humans.

# What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed? 
During this class I have noticed many strenghts such as note taking, I am able to read paragraphs of information and effectively compact it into dot points, ensuring all the information is still in tact whilst condensing the word count. This is extremely helpful for this subject as there is a lot of information in this class. Weaknesses I have observed this week is my attention span, I must condition myself to pay attention to the content the tutor is covering. Althought Complex Systems is quite a long class I must ensure I have my undivided attention whilst present in class.

# What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them? 
Challengers include timing and focus. The timing of this class is quite late into the day and right after my economics tutorial, because of this I have to ensure I finish economics on time to be present in class for Complex Systems. My focus is also lacking, I find myself zoning out sometimes, to combat this I like to take a short stroll during the breaks offered during the workshop. 

# What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results? 
Next week I will ensure I have had enough food to eat and am ready to focus in class. I believe this will ensure I yield better results in class and stay focused for longer periods of time.

# What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this? 
The definitions was definitely the stand out for this workshop, the basic definition of the technical language used in this course allowed me to grasp an understanding of more difficult concepts and systems. I find that I overlook basic definitions such as systems and adaptive, underestimating their meaning and importance. I have learnt the definition of these word in the correct context and I believe this will serve me well going further into this course.
